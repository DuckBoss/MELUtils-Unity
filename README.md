# MELUtils-Unity
Utility scripts to help create audio visualizers in Unity.

### MelUtils.dll is a compiled library of MelLog.cpp/MelLog.h

## Main Usage :
Use the MelUtils.dll for faster processing.
- Import the MelUtils.dll to the Unity projects ../Assets/Plugins/ folder.
- If you use the DLL, you don't need to import anything else.

## Alternative Usage :
You could also use the C# scripts provided instead of the DLL.
- Import the MelLog.cs/SpectrumData.cs to the Unity projects ../Assets/ folder.

## Additional Versions:
I've also uploaded a JavaScript version of MelUtils which can be used for non-unity projects.
